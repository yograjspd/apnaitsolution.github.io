                                            and signoff certain sections. As a project is a combination of these smaller

                                            of omission of you, or by one of your subcontractors or agents, the project

                                            recommend an automated scheduled back-up, which can be set-up alongside any

                                            (SEO) work does take place on the live server). On occasion, it may be
                                            requested that development takes places on live servers (time constraints,
                                            upon client request, licensing reasons for example). This is done so at your
